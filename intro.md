## Introduction of Pets
I would like to introduce my two cats.
They are brothers, the first is black and the second is white.

1. The first cat was named "Koku".
    - Koku is very elegant and intelligent.
    - He is not timid in loud places or places with many people.

2. The second cat was named "Miru".
    - Miru is very energetic and has charm.
    - She always seems to be enjoying itself and loves playing with toys and chasing my feet.
